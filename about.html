                <h2>For Kamyia</h2>
                <p class="story-text">This company is named after Kamyia Fletcher—my niece, a dedicated teacher who gave everything to her students. At 29, she passed away, having sacrificed so much of herself to a system that demanded more than it should have asked.</p>
                
                <p class="story-text">Kamyia's story isn't unique. Across every profession—teaching, healthcare, administration—people are burning out. Not because they lack passion or capability, but because systems burden them with endless administrative tasks that steal time from what actually matters: the human connections, the breakthroughs, the moments that change lives.</p>
                
                <p class="story-text emphasis">We're changing that.</p>

                    <h3>Dr. Ayinde Rudolph, Ed.D.</h3>
                    <p>I spent 25 years in education. I was a teacher. A principal. A superintendent of Mountain View Whisman School District. I lived the problem I'm now solving.</p>
                    
                    <p>I watched teachers drown in paperwork when they should have been connecting with students. I saw brilliant educators leave the profession—not because they stopped caring, but because the system made it impossible to care and survive.</p>
                    
                    <p>44% of teachers leave within five years. That's not a retention problem. That's a system failure.</p>
                    
                    <div class="founder-highlight">
                        <h4>A Lifelong Tech Enthusiast</h4>
                        <p>I've always been drawn to technology's potential. From coding in GW-BASIC in high school, to building websites in college, to becoming the only non-superintendent recognized by President Obama and Secretary Duncan for my approach to Digital Learning, to leading the development of a city-wide CBRS network in Mountain View—I've spent my career at the intersection of education and technology.</p>
                        
                        <p>But watching Jean come to life has been different. In 10 months, I've built a new version every single month—each one more sophisticated than the last. The current iteration, built with Rust and Tauri, represents not just technical evolution but a fundamental reimagining of how AI should work.</p>
                        
                        <p>This isn't a tech founder who read about education problems. This is an educator who became a tech founder because no one else was building what we actually needed.</p>
